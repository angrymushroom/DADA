# DADA Project Roadmap

## Vision
To provide comprehensive, real-time, and historical analytics for Cardano DeFi protocols, empowering users with actionable insights into Total Value Locked (TVL), token prices, APY, and risk metrics.

## Strategic Pillars
1.  **Data Accuracy & Reliability:** Ensure all collected data is accurate, up-to-date, and sourced from reliable on-chain and off-chain providers.
2.  **Comprehensive Coverage:** Expand data collection to include a wider range of Cardano DeFi protocols and metrics.
3.  **User Empowerment:** Deliver intuitive and insightful analytics through a user-friendly interface.
4.  **Scalability & Maintainability:** Build a robust and scalable data pipeline and backend infrastructure.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Ingestion & API Integration (Current Focus)
*   **Objective:** Establish foundational data pipelines for key DeFi metrics.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Dynamic TVL fetching for Minswap, Indigo, Liqwid.
    *   Real-time token price fetching (e.g., ADA, MIN, iUSD, LQ) via CoinGecko.
    *   APY data collection for Liqwid.
    *   Top wallet and risk metrics data collection.
    *   Initial database schema for storing collected data.
    *   Basic data retention policies.
*   **Target Completion:** Q3 2025

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics & Frontend Integration
*   **Objective:** Develop advanced analytical capabilities and integrate data into the frontend.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Historical data visualization for TVL, prices, and APY.
    *   Interactive charts and dashboards in the frontend.
    *   User-defined alerts for key metrics.
    *   Expansion of risk metrics (e.g., impermanent loss, liquidity depth).
    *   Integration of additional DeFi protocols (e.g., SundaeSwap, WingRiders).
*   **Target Completion:** Q4 2025

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Platform Expansion
*   **Objective:** Introduce sophisticated features and explore broader platform capabilities.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Predictive analytics and forecasting for DeFi metrics.
    *   Integration with more diverse data sources (e.g., on-chain transaction data).
    *   User authentication and personalized dashboards.
    *   API endpoints for external consumption of DADA data.
    *   Community features (e.g., forum, user-contributed insights).
*   **Target Completion:** Q1 2026 and beyond

## Future Considerations
*   Integration with other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) for cross-chain DeFi analytics.
*   Development of a mobile application.
*   Monetization strategies (e.g., premium features, API access).
